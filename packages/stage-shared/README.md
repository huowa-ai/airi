# `@proj-airi/stage-shared`

Shared contracts and runtime-neutral helpers for AIRI stage applications and UI packages.

## Use this package

Use this package when a type or behavior must cross stage application boundaries without depending on Electron, browser-only code, or a feature UI package.

The `plugin-host` entrypoint owns the serializable Plugin Host snapshots exchanged between the Electron main process and shared renderer code:

```ts
import type { PluginHostDebugSnapshot } from '@proj-airi/stage-shared/plugin-host'
```

The `model-assets` entrypoint owns model file manifests, download status, and
the storage adapter contract. Use a platform adapter to store and open files.
It does not own a recognizer or Worker.

`resolveServerUrl` in `src/env-vars.ts` picks the AIRI API origin. `VITE_SERVER_URL` wins. Development uses the local gateway. Production uses the hosted API.

The `speaker-model` entrypoint pins the CAM++ speaker embedding pack. The renderer and the Electron main process both read it:

```ts
import { speakerModel } from '@proj-airi/stage-shared/speaker-model'
```

## Do not use this package

Keep Electron IPC definitions in the Electron application. Keep UI state and actions in `@proj-airi/stage-ui`. Keep Extension runtime and manifest behavior in `@proj-airi/plugin-sdk`.

Do not add application startup, persistence, or platform-specific side effects here.
